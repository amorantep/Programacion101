    "description": "Since we were following a self-guided walking tour, I had some information on all the attractions that we went to. We got to this arch, the Triumphpforte, and I started reading about the arch and why it was erected. In 1765, it was erected for the wedding of Emperor Leopold II and Maria Ludovica. Leopold's father, Francis Stephen, died shortly before the wedding, so on one side of the arch depicts the wedding, and on the other side is a memorial to Francis. It was rather funny reading about the arch and about the wedding when one sentence started talking about the groom's father dying. Maybe we have a morbid sense of humor, but that was a great start to our walking tour.  View this photo on my blog <a href=\"https://www.noahclark.org/?6844\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">here</a>.",
