    "description": "One of the cool things about the ice cave tour was that we got carbide lamps. Highly unsafe, but somewhat of a tradition for the tours through the cave. Katherine got to hold the lamp, and it appeared to be leaking something which didn't seem very good! We found out that the way the lamps work is by combining calcium carbide with water to form acetylene fuel. This was the last photo I was allowed to take before we entered the cave.
