    "description": "\n<b>Address/Title</b>: 601 1/2 to 617 North First Street\n\n<b>Photographer</b>: Zehmer, John G. (John Granderson), 1942-\n\n<b>Original Description (from Book)</b>: This is the longest row of united houses in Jackson Ward. It was built in part of Jackson's garden. The cornices and jigsaw porches are all united. Only one unit has had a porch of 1920 vintage substituted for the original. The segmental brick arched windows have slightly projected brick trim. Most of the wood picket fences are in place although not all are well-maintained. The color schemes of all the houses are typical of the eighties.\n\n<b>City/Location</b>: Richmond (Va.)\n\n<b>Date of photograph</b>: ca. 1978\n\n<b>Map URL</b>: <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=37.547746,+-77.438205+(601 1/2 North First Street , Richmond, VA)&amp;iwloc=A&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">maps.google.com/maps?q=37.547746,+-77.438205+(601%201/2%2...</a>\n\n<b>Original Publication</b>: Zehmer, John G., and Robert P.
